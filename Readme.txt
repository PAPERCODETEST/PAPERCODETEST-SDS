# Secure Data Sharing: Blockchain-Enabled Access Control Framework for Digital Cousin Data in Healthcare

## 1. Description

This repository provides the reference implementation and experimental artifacts for the research work entitled:

**Secure Data Sharing: Blockchain-Enabled Access Control Framework for Digital Cousin Data in Healthcare**

With the rapid adoption of Digital Twin (DT) technology, healthcare systems increasingly rely on large-scale data integration across heterogeneous IoT environments. However, conventional DT-based solutions often suffer from high modeling costs, excessive computational overhead, and significant security and privacy risks. To address these challenges, this project adopts the concept of **Digital Cousins (DCs)**, which serve as lightweight digital representations that preserve essential contextual characteristics—such as spatial structures and semantic cues—without requiring full physical replication.

To ensure secure and fine-grained access control over sensitive healthcare data, this framework integrates **Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE)** with a **blockchain-enabled decentralized authorization mechanism**. Encrypted Digital Cousin data are stored off-chain using the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**, while access policies and authorization records are maintained on-chain to eliminate single points of failure and improve scalability. The proposed framework enables secure, efficient, and low-latency data sharing for complex healthcare IoT environments.

## 2. Dataset Information

This repository uses **synthetic healthcare Digital Cousin datasets** generated exclusively for experimental and evaluation purposes. No real patient data is included.

The dataset consists of:
- Simulated physiological and contextual data generated by Digital Cousin models
- Attribute sets defining access control policies (e.g., role, department, authorization level)
- Metadata used for indexing and retrieval through IPFS

## 3.  Code Information

## 5. Methodology

The proposed framework follows these key steps:

1. Generate Digital Cousin data to represent healthcare entities in a lightweight manner.

2. Define fine-grained access policies based on user attributes.

3. Encrypt Digital Cousin data using CP-ABE under specified access policies.

4. Store encrypted data in IPFS and obtain content identifiers (CIDs).

5. Record access policies and CIDs on the blockchain via smart contracts.

6. Verify user attributes and authorization on-chain.

7. Retrieve and decrypt data only for authorized users.
